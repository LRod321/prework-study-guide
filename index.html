      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <UL>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        <li> HTML uses the 'id' attribute as a way to identify elements and select them.</li>
        <li>It is composed of elements defined by tags, like < h1 >, < p >, < a >, etc.</li>
        <li>Common Tags:
         <ul>•< h1 > to < h6 >: Headings.</ul>
         <ul>•< p >: Paragraph.</ul>
         <ul>•< a >: Anchor (links).</ul>
         <ul>•< img >: Image.</ul>             
         <ul>•< ul >, < ol >, < li >: Lists (unordered, ordered, list item).</ul>
         <ul>•< div >: Division (block-level container).</ul>
         <ul>•< span>: Inline container.</ul>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Cascading Style Sheets(CSS): Used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
        <li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetiics, visual layout, and organization.</li>
        <li>inline CSS: Used when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file. useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, becasue each inline style must be edited individually when you make a design. Applies to a specific HTML tag.</li>
        <li>internal CSS style sheet:Possible to embed entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file if within the < head > element. Used to style multiple elements in the page code</li>
        <li>external CSS style sheet: Is the most common way to style a webpage. Allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a seperate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
        <li>Declarations contain two important components: The CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
        <li>Margin: Property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>Padding: Property adds space around the content inside an element. </li>
        <li>Special wild card symbol (*): We have declared that ALL of the elemnts on the page will have the style properties (margin, padding) set as 0.</li> 
        <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done by semantic references such as 'gray' or 'blue'. We can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex#</li>
        <li>The different types of selectors: ID, Class, Attribute and Pseudo-class selector.</li>

      <h2>Git</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
        <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
        <li>git pull: Fetch and merge changes from the remote repository</li>
        <li>git push: Push committed changes to the remote repository</li>
        <li>git merge (branch): Merge a branch into the current branch</li>
        <li>git status: Check the status of your working directory and staging area</li>
        <li>git log: Show the commit history</li>
        <li>git commit -m "message": Commit staged changes with a descriptive message</li>
        <li>git add (file): Stage changes (prepare them to be committed)</li>
        <li>git clone (url): Clone an existing repository from a URL</li>
        <li>Git is used for version control, a system that manages changes to a projects code, documentation, or other digital content over time</li>
        <li>Allows collaboration between developers to work on different parts of the project simultaneously</li>

      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Can power websites with effects, interactivity, data communication, and more.</li>
      <li>Nan("Not a Number") is the only value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself.</li>
      <li>BigInt type is a numeric primitive in JavaScript that can represent intergers with arbitrary magnitude.</li>
      <li>String type represents extual data and is encoded as a sequence of 16-bit unsigned integer values representing UTF-16 code units</li>
      <li>Symbol is a unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an Object property </li>
      <li>Variable ("var"): simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
      <li>(console.log.) The word console refers to a test environment that developers use to check out their code. The second part, .log(), is a method, which means a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer. The .log() method will output whatever we add inside the parentheses to the console.</li>
      <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
      <li>A value is considered "falsy" if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false. All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered "truthy"</li>
      <li>Using "if" statements allows us to interrupt control flow.</li>
      <li>Array: A single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
      <li>"var": Variable</li>
      <li>A "for" loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
      <li> Function: Are reusable blocks of code that contain instructions to perform a specific task.</li>
